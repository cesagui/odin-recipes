    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Frijoles Charros</strong>, or Mexican Charro Beans, are a hearty Mexican bean soup featuring tender pinto beans, smoky bacon, and fiery chorizo sausage in a tomato-based broth. With savoury layers from aromatics and warm notes from traditional spices, this fiesta in a bowl is not your average pot of beans. It's satisfying, flavourful, and perfect with a side of crusty bread for dipping.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pinto Beans</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Chorizo Sausage</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>Diced Tomatos</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>Beef Stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by cooking the bacon and chorizo. Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes. Crumble the chorizo into the pot and continue cooking until browned, approximately another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the chorizo and bacon from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Next, saut√© the aromatics in the same pot. Add the diced onion to the pot and cook until it becomes soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Replace the cooked bacon and chorizo in the pot. Stir in the ground cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, and bay leaf. Cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Do not allow the spices to burn.</li>
        <li>Finally, pour in the beef broth (or chicken broth) and the diced tomatoes into the pot, then add the soaked pinto beans. Season with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring bean mixture to a boil, then reduce heat, cover with a lid, and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until the beans are tender. If needed, add 1 cup hot liquid (water or more stock) and continue cooking until the beans are soft but not falling apart.</li>
        <li>Garnish Frijoles Charros with chopped fresh cilantro and serve hot with tortillas, rice, and your favourite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
